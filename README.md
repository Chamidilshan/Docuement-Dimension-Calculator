# Document-Dimension-Calculator

This Matlab project uses various image processing techniques to scan and digitize documents. The program reads an input image and converts it to grayscale. It then applies thresholding, edge detection, and dilation to find the boundaries of the document. The program calculates the width and height of the document and converts the values to centimeters. Finally, the program displays the output image with the detected boundaries and the width and height values.
